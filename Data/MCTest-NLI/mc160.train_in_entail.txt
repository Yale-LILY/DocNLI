non_entailment	In a far away land known as Board, there was a great man named Pawn. This was a very odd land because the only thing to do was play chess. Pawn did not very much care for chess as he was very bored with it. Another problem Pawn had was that he didn't like some of the other people in this land. They had names like Bishop, Queen, Rook, and Knight. And most of all, there was King. He was the greatest person in Board. One day, during their normal battle, Pawn saw an opening to move to the far end of Board. He almost got hurt by Knight but he got away. Amazingly, when he got to the other end he became as powerful as Queen. With this amazing power, Pawn chose to help keep King safe. All was well until Pawn woke up and knew that it was only a dream. He was still Pawn.	Pawn almost hurt Pawn.

entailment	Flying a kite can be dangerous. When I was eight years old I went to the park with my dad to fly my new kite. We stood on the top of a hill and tried to catch the wind. It took us almost half an hour, but we finally got the kite into the air. As it lifted into the sky, the kite caught the edge of my jacket and I was pulled up into the wind with the kite. I flew higher and higher into the air until I my dad looked like an ant on the ground. The park was beautiful from up high, and I could see our car getting smaller. I flew all the way out of the city and over the lake. Eventually, the wind started to die down and I fell closer to the water. I called out to some people on a boat and they sailed over so I could land on their boat. I told them about my adventure and they sailed me back to land, where my dad picked me up. He took me out for ice cream and we went home.	Her father was the main character flying a kite with.

non_entailment	The first grade class went on a bus to visit a farm. The farm was a long ways from their school. The farm was also far away from any other farms or houses. The farmers who lived there were the Nixon family. They grew corn. Sometimes when the weather was right, they would plant wheat, too. The fields were so large that the class could not see where they ended. Mr. Nixon gave all of the children a long ride in the fields on his tractor. The Nixon family also had a lot of farm animals. In the red barn next to their home, they kept a few cows and horses. Everyone fed hay to some of the cows. The farmers got milk from their cows. Some of the class got small bottles of fresh milk to take home with them. All the kids got to ride on the big brown horses the Nixons had. They went up into the nearby hills, where they could look down on the farm below. Around the farmyard there were many goats and chickens, who wandered around as they wished.

non_entailment	I used to be afraid of butterflies!  It is true!  Once, my mom took me to Seattle.  There, we went to a special place.  We went to the zoo!  I saw lots of animals at the zoo.  I saw bears.  I saw tigers.  I saw apes.  I saw monkeys.  I saw snakes.  I loved seeing all these animals.  They made me happy.  We even saw one place where there were giant bugs and they didn't even scare me.  In fact, I like bugs.  But there was one place where you walked inside a big room where there were lots of plants and butterflies flying all over the place.  You could buy sugar water to feed them and they could land on you.  My mom and brother were so excited to go in, but I was scared.  I wasn't sure that I wanted to be in the room with butterflies flying everywhere.  My mom said I would be okay.  My brother said I would be okay.  They said butterflies were nice and beautiful.  They said they would not hurt me.  So I went in the room.  Guess what?  I was so scared when one landed on me that I went screaming for the door! The man watching the door to make sure butterflies did not escape or get hurt yelled at me to stop.  He was mad at me for running out and not caring about the butterflies.  I said I was sorry, but I was scared.  He checked me for butterflies and then let me get out of there!  I stayed outside and my mom and my brother enjoyed the butterflies.  Since then, they would tease me about being afraid.  They would try and get me to not be afraid.  Last year for my birthday, mom bought me a butterfly book.  She bought one for my brother, too.  I tried really hard to not be afraid and to go out into the yard and find butterflies with my brother.  It became really fun to do.  Once, a butterfly landed on me and I laughed.  I liked it.  It tickled me.  It did not hurt me.  Now, I like butterflies!	the child go when he sawed the butterflies in To the movie.

I tried really hard to not be afraid and to go out into the yard and find butterflies with my brother.  It became really fun to do.  Once, a butterfly landed on me and I laughed.  I liked it.  It tickled me.  It did not hurt me.  Now, I like butterflies!	the child afraid of is butterflies.
non_entailment	I used to be afraid of butterflies!  It is true!  Once, my mom took me to Seattle.  There, we went to a special place.  We went to the zoo!  I saw lots of animals at the zoo.  I saw bears.  I saw tigers.  I saw apes.  I saw monkeys.  I saw snakes.  I loved seeing all these animals.  They made me happy.  We even saw one place where there were giant bugs and they didn't even scare me.  In fact, I like bugs.  But there was one place where you walked inside a big room where there were lots of plants and butterflies flying all over the place.  You could buy sugar water to feed them and they could land on you.  My mom and brother were so excited to go in, but I was scared.  I wasn't sure that I wanted to be in the room with butterflies flying everywhere.  My mom said I would be okay.  My brother said I would be okay.  They said butterflies were nice and beautiful.  They said they would not hurt me.  So I went in the room.  Guess what?  I was so scared when one landed on me that I went screaming for the door! The man watching the door to make sure butterflies did not escape or get hurt yelled at me to stop.  He was mad at me for running out and not caring about the butterflies.  I said I was sorry, but I was scared.  He checked me for butterflies and then let me get out of there!  I stayed outside and my mom and my brother enjoyed the butterflies.

non_entailment	There was once a land named Catatonia where cats ran things. Cats walked and talked much as you do except they walked on four legs. There were cat policemen, cat firemen, cat teachers, and even a cat bus driver. Most of the cats were very busy.     The King of Catatonia was a small cat named Diggs. He had two brothers named Pouncer and Flash who helped him rule in Catatonia. Pouncer was head of the Milk, Cheese and Cream center and Flash's job was to blow things up. Together the three of them made sure all the cats were happy, had plenty to drink and got to enjoy bright fireworks shows in the distance.

non_entailment	Mary was a little girl who loved to sew. She liked to sew dresses, shirts, and skirts but Mary hated to sew quilts. She didn't like anything about sewing quilts and blankets because it took too long. One quilt or blanket took a week to make, when a skirt or shirt took one night! Mary's mother didn't understand why Mary didn't like to sew quilts and blankets because Mary's mother loved to!  Mary was a normal little girl even if her friends didn't think so all the time. Mary's friends liked to play games and play outside but all Mary liked was to sew. She woke up and she began to sew. She only stopped to eat and use the bathroom. Mary's father was very worried about Mary. He said that little girls needed to laugh and play, not sew all the time.   One day Mary's father took Mary's sewing things and gave them to the poor children. "No more sewing, Mary!" He said. He wanted her to go laugh and play with her friends instead of sew but instead of going outside to play she ran into her room and cried. Mary was very sad that she couldn't sew any more. Soon her friends came over to see why Mary hadn't come over to play like her father said she would. When they saw her crying on her bed they had to think of a way to cheer her up. Billy said that maybe they could let her sew at their houses. Abby thought it was a great idea. So then all Mary's friends bought sewing things with their money so that Mary would be happy again. When Mary's father saw Mary go to one of her friend's house he was very happy. Soon everyone was happy again.	Mary liked to sew blankets, dresses, and shirts.

Cindy felt horrible now that she had talked about the party that her friend was not going to.  Mary found it hard to pay attention to the teacher now. She kept thinking over and over why Allison didn't invite her to the party. Did Mary do something to make Allison mad or to hurt her? She couldn't understand it. Her eyes started to get wet with tears. She was hoping that no one saw this. Mary thought she saw Allison looking at her in a funny way. Suddenly Mary felt like she was going to start crying. She reached into her desk to pull out some tissues. She felt a strange  piece of paper. She pulled it out and there was the invitation to Allison's party. It had gotten mixed up in her papers in her desk. She immediately started to smile. She smiled at Allison and at Cindy. Cindy gave her a puzzled look because she thought that Mary was sad.   At lunch Mary explained everything to Cindy. Then Mary, Allison, and Cindy all went off to play.	Mary found in her desk a test.

His name was Eh. He said, "close your eyes! Then remember the most happy you have ever felt! Let go of any thing that feels like clouds. Imagine puppies hugging you, and kitties purring with you. Imagine you are eating chocolate ice cream!  As long as you remember how to be happy  you can ALWAYS be as young as Eduardo! And you can think of GREAT ways you can see him again!"  It worked!

Imagine you are eating chocolate ice cream!  As long as you remember how to be happy  you can ALWAYS be as young as Eduardo! And you can think of GREAT ways you can see him again!"  It worked! She had an idea. Someone in a place called MR was buying stories that people wrote. She wrote one about her & Eduardo!  It paid for her airplane ride. Wow.  Then they were together again. Hugging each other in happiness, they said, "Thank you everyone,  for helping us!"	it snowing is in Argentina.
non_entailment	A boy named Eduardo in a far away place is thinking about a girl he loves.  He is cold. It is snowing where he lives. He lives in Argentina.  It's warm where she lives in Hawaii. She eats fresh fruit.  Her shower is outdoors under the warm sun as red birds fly around her. It is nice, but she misses him.  She remembers he is very pretty. She wondered if he would really love her always,  because she is older.  He didn't care. Eduardo was poor, so he could not visit her.   Maybe a time machine would help!!

non_entailment	Once upon a time, there was a boy named Freddy.   And Freddy loved his mom very much, and his mom loved him very much too.  One day, Freddy went outside to ride his bike.  On the way out, his mother told him, "Remember to wear your helmet," and Freddy grabbed his helmet and met his friends outside.  When he was putting on his helmet, his friends told him, "Helmets are for girls!  You're not cool if you wear a helmet!"  Freddy thought about what his mom told him, but he wanted to be cool like his friends, and he took off his helmet.  Freddy and his friends went on a long adventure, and they rode all the way to the top of the largest hill in their neighborhood.  Looking down, Freddy was scared.  He had never ridden down this hill before.  His friends said, "What are you, scared?"  Freddy did not want to come off as scared.  He hopped on his bicycle, and down he went.  Freddy started speeding up, going very, very fast.  He pressed his brakes, but oh no, his brakes weren't working.  Freddy, speeding down the hill, did not know what to do.  He got to the end of the hill and slammed right into a tree.  He awoke the next day in the hospital.  At the hospital, his mother was there.  Freddy opened his eyes and told his mom the whole story.  He told her how we would never do that again, and how he would always wear his helmet.  His mom gave him a big kiss on the forehead, and Freddy knew his mother was right in the beginning.  She didn't have to say it.  In the end, Freddy learned that it's important to not care what other people think, and those that think you're not cool because you wear a helmet are the ones that aren't cool in the first place.

Winston was black and very fat. They were very happy rabbits who loved to eat. Every day they would leave their home, cross a road, and go through a small forest to get to a meadow of grass. They loved to eat that grass. One day, Chester thought he smelled something interesting. At first he thought it might be dirt. Then he thought maybe some sort of flower. So, he asked a nearby squirrel. The squirrel's name was Acorn. Acorn said that he thought it was mushrooms.

entailment	Late in the evening, the wind blew hard around the little house. The sound of the wind is like someone crying. It made the old woman nervous. She had not been getting much sleep lately, but with the wind making the spooky noise, she didn't know what else to do but lie down and try to rest a little.  Once she lay down to try to sleep, many memories of her life in the little house kept her mind busy. She still was having trouble falling asleep. She remembered being a little girl and her dad putting the finishing touches on the house. Her mom loved the big kitchen, and she and her younger sister had their own room in the back.  It was in this, her old bedroom, that she was trying to sleep. The crying sound got louder. It didn't seem like it was outside. It sounded like it was coming from the other side of the bed. When she turned and looked, she saw her younger sister. She still looked five years old. The old woman couldn't remember her any other way, as she had died from a sickness at age five.  "What's wrong?" she asked her sister. "I miss you. I am so lonely," answered the little girl, who was so thin you could see through her. The old lady closed her eyes and reached for her sister. That is how they found her the next day, holding her pillow and smiling.  "She died in her sleep." "It is best that way."	the sound of the wind made the old woman nervous.

non_entailment	The best afternoon I ever had with my grandfather was when we went down to the river and fished.  It was a hot July day, and I was bored. My grandfather was sitting in the backyard, reading. "Hey, you look like you need some fun," he said.  "Want to go fishing?" I said sure, and he went to the garage.  He came out with two poles, some hooks, and some fishing line. Everything was in pieces, but he showed me how to put it all together.  I asked if we needed worms, and he said no. Then, we set off to the river.  It was only about ten blocks to the river, but walking along past the library and the store, he told me about how he used to go fishing with his friend Steve. They used to catch catfish, then take them home so that their mothers could cook them for dinner.  When we got to the park at the river, my grandfather went right to the bank, then turned and walked up along the side of the river until we were off in the shade under the trees right at the edge of the park. There, he taught me how to throw my line in the water. Then we sat down to wait. While we were fishing, my grandfather told me lots of stories about what he and Steve did as kids. We didn't have any worms, so we never caught any fish, but sitting there as he told me stories made it a great afternoon.	they walked past Park.

non_entailment	Joey got a German Shepherd for his birthday present. He had never had any pets before, but was always excited to see the other dogs and cats in his neighborhood. Since his birthday was in June, he spent a lot of time playing outside with his new puppy, which he named Max. Max and Joey would often run through fields in a game of chase. They also liked to go through the small forest behind the house, making a game of hide and seek. They never went near the lake because Joey was afraid of water. One day, Max hid a little too well and Joey couldn't find him. Joey spent the afternoon looking for his German Shepherd where they often played, like the field and forest. Joey was a shy boy who often read by himself, and Max was his best friend.  After dinner, he went to look for Max one last time before he had to take a bath and go to bed. He heard some barking on the next street, so he ran to see if it was his puppy. Sure enough, he saw Max playing with a poodle. The dogs were having so much fun. Joey brought Max home, happy that he had his puppy back. Max seemed to be happy to have his human by his side as well as a new doggy friend. All summer long, Joey took Max to the poodle's house so they could play without having to worry about losing his present.	dog is in At his friend's house.

Their moms thought that because they competed with each other they might become mean towards one another but they did not let that get in the way of their friendship.  In their latest recital Eliza had got the top part in the dance called "The Beauty and the Rain". The hours were long and draining on their bodies. All the girls and boys who left the performance center looked so tired. They couldn't pick up their practice bags off of the floor as they walked to their parents to go home and their eyelids were droopy. When Eliza got home, the last thing on her mind was her math problems. All she could think of was bathing her sore feet and her head hitting her soft fluffy pillow.  Her teachers started to become aware of Eliza's problems in the classroom and called her parents into school to talk to her teachers. Her parents knew that dancing was Eliza's dream and would not let anything get in the way of her performances.

He remembered that he once hit the ball so hard that it flew out of the park. Home run!  He was also a fan of basketball. He enjoyed watching people on television pull off crazy tricks like slam dunking (but he didn't really like all of the passes). He wasn't quite that good yet, but he was pretty good at making shots from the three point line. He knew that if he kept practicing, he would be really great someday.  Finally, he loved football.
