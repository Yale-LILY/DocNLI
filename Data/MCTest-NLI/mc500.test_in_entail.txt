non_entailment	Once there was a beautiful fish named Asta. Asta lived in the ocean. There were lots of other fish in the ocean where Asta lived. They played all day long.  One day, a bottle floated by over the heads of Asta and his friends. They looked up and saw the bottle. "What is it?" said Asta's friend Sharkie. "It looks like a bird's belly," said Asta. But when they swam closer, it was not a bird's belly. It was hard and clear, and there was something inside it.   The bottle floated above them. They wanted to open it. They wanted to see what was inside. So they caught the bottle and carried it down to the bottom of the ocean. They cracked it open on a rock. When they got it open, they found what was inside. It was a note. The note was written in orange crayon on white paper. Asta could not read the note. Sharkie could not read the note. They took the note to Asta's papa. "What does it say?" they asked.   Asta's papa read the note. He told Asta and Sharkie, "This note is from a little girl. She wants to be your friend. If you want to be her friend, we can write a note to her. But you have to find another bottle so we can send it to her." And that is what they did.	Asta and Sharkie became friends with the little girl They asked her to come play with them in the ocean.

Alexis was nice to Derek, but Sandy kept being mean. Sandy kicked dirt at Derek and called him mean names. Alexis felt bad that her friend was so nasty to Derek. Derek knew that Sandy did not like him, so he sat down in the school yard with a big frown. All of a sudden, a stranger walked up to Derek and asked him if he wanted some rock sugar candy. He told Derek he had lots of sugar rock candy in his car in the parking lot. Derek remembered his parents telling him never to talk to strangers, so he started running away from the man. Sandy and Alexis were on the jungle gym and they saw Derek running from the stranger. They went to tell their teacher, Mrs. Mustard, who was still inside the classroom. Sandy and Alexis came into the classroom screaming for help. Derek ran into the classroom right after the girls. Mrs. Mustard looked out into the recess yard, but the stranger was gone. Jenny, Mrs. Mustard's helper, called the police to report what had happened.	Sandy called the police.

She has a lot of fun in the kitchen making new foods. She likes to pretend she's a cook! Someday she wants to be a piggy princess cook! One of her favorite things to cook is pea soup.

non_entailment	There was once a group of kittens who all liked to play together. Their names were Fluffy, Snowball, Cookie Monster, and Larry. Fluffy was the leader of the group, and whatever he said, the others did. One day he said, "Hey, everybody, let's go chase some mice." Everyone said "Yes!" except Larry. Larry did not want to chase mice. Larry wanted to drink some milk. He told Fluffy, and Fluffy only said "too bad." So everyone went off to chase mice. The next day Fluffy said, "Hey, everybody, let's go annoy the dogs." Everyone said "Yes" except Larry. Larry thought it was a bad idea. He told Fluffy, and Fluffy only said, "Too bad." So everyone went off to annoy the dogs. Except Larry. When the cats annoyed the dogs, the dogs became very angry. They started growling. They caught the kittens in their paws. The kittens yelled, "Help us!" Larry heard, and he ran over and hissed at the dogs. The dogs could not see Larry, only his shadow, which looked very big. The dogs got scared and ran away, and the kittens cheered. "Yay Larry! We'll do anything you want!"	the leader was Cookie Monster.

non_entailment	Hi there! How are you doing today? I was hanging out with my friend earlier today. I am looking for a guy in a blue shirt and blue pants. Have you seen him? I cannot find him, and I thought I looked everywhere. I have checked behind the green couch and he was not there. I looked inside the white refrigerator and he was not there either. I looked to the left and looked to the right of the television and he was not in those places either!  Where would you look for someone? Where would you look in their house? I think he could be in one of the other rooms here. I checked in the living room and it was empty. I checked in the bedroom and it was empty too! I knocked on the bathroom door and that was empty. It is easy to find him because he is in blue.  Wait, what's that? You said you saw someone in the kitchen? What were they wearing? Were they wearing a blue shirt? Oh they weren't? I think that could still be my friend! I'll head over to the kitchen, you can follow if you want. There's my friend! And he's wearing an orange shirt now; he must have left to change his shirt. Thank you so much!	green color did I say he was wearing.

I think he could be in one of the other rooms here. I checked in the living room and it was empty. I checked in the bedroom and it was empty too! I knocked on the bathroom door and that was empty. It is easy to find him because he is in blue.  Wait, what's that? You said you saw someone in the kitchen? What were they wearing? Were they wearing a blue shirt? Oh they weren't? I think that could still be my friend! I'll head over to the kitchen, you can follow if you want. There's my friend! And he's wearing an orange shirt now; he must have left to change his shirt. Thank you so much!	my friend was in the kitchen room.

At night, Grandma and Grandpa would make dinner and they would eat outside by the pool. On special nights, Josh got to get ice cream for dessert.

When I see my friends at school later they wish me happy birthday. My friends like me, but sometimes it is not so easy to get together. That's a stinker when that happens.

You can also ride your bike, meet up with friends during any time of the day, or maybe even eat ice-cream for breakfast! I have a birthday during the warmer summer weather and sometimes it is hard to get all my friends together at my home for cake and presents because they are on vacation! When I see my friends at school later they wish me happy birthday. My friends like me, but sometimes it is not so easy to get together. That's a stinker when that happens. It's a good thing that I have a pig named Joseph to be my friend during those times! I also have other friends, like a cat and a dog, but Joseph is the best. He's a stinker sometimes, but he's got cute little oinks to help me to know what he needs. He's also very sweet, caring, and he's always ready to listen. He's a wonderful friend.	my birthday is on During the winter.

non_entailment	The red fox slowly walked out of his den he lives in; his own house in the ground. His eyes bounced side to side as he made sure the coast was clear, then he ran down the path of autumn leaves. As he reached the end there was a an apple tree without leaves, but still one shiny red colored apple hung from a branch. He climbed up a nearby rock and took a running start towards the branch, jumping and barely grabbing on. He slowly crawled along the branch towards the shiny apple, and as he drew close, he reached out a paw towards the apple. He knocked the apple from the branch and it to the forest floor. The fox slipped and he fell off the branch, but landed safely in a pile of leaves near the apple. He picked up the apple in his mouth and quickly brought it back to his warm den. When he arrived back home, his two fox kits were waiting for him with hungry tummies. Spring, summer, autumn, or winter, it was always warm in the fox den.	Mrs. Fox did the fox get the apple for.

Turtle was lots of fun and always told funny jokes.  He thought about Fox. Fox was super nice and always made Little Bunny feel good.  He also thought about how not inviting one of his friends would make them feel bad.  Little Bunny didn't want to make anyone feel bad. After a little bit he had an idea.  He told his mother his idea. "I like both Turtle and Fox, and I want them both to come.  One would feel really left out if they didn't get invited.  I can give my cake to one of my friends, and that way they can both come and have a piece." His mother thought it was very sweet of Little Bunny to give up his piece of birthday cake so that none of his friends would feel left out. "I'll tell you what." Said his mother.  "I'll make a batch of cupcakes, and all of your friends can have some."	Turtle was having a birthday.

non_entailment	There once was a beautiful, brown puppy who loved her life.  Her name was Tori.  Every morning, Patty brushed out her fur and feeds Tori her favorite breakfast.  One Tuesday morning, Patty had an early errand and forgot all about Tori.  Tori was sad, but chose to make the best of it, and leaped out of her doggy door to play in her backyard outside.  As she was playing with her favorite ball, Tori saw an opening in the fence.  Excited, she ran over to the fence and squeezed out.  She had never been on the street by herself before.  Tori ran down the sidewalk, and happily barked at all the other dogs she passed.  She loved to wag her tail in the summer breeze and was having a great time.    All of a sudden, Tori was picked up by Ben and Mike, and thrown into a truck.  She was lost and confused.  Poor Tori didn't know what to do!  The truck pulled up to a building with a big sign that said "Animal Control".  Tori knew this was the place that people keep animals who are lost on the street.  Once the workers took her inside, they put her into a cage.  She was scared that Patty wouldn't know where to find her, but she knew Patty's phone number was on her collar.  She barked and barked to get the worker's attention, but no one seemed to pay her any attention.    After two long hours, a tall man, named Joe, opened up her cage and looked at the charm on her collar.  He smiled at Tori and gave her a pat on the head.  Patty was there quickly, and gave Tori a big hug.  She was so happy to see her puppy again.  Tori learned to never escape the backyard again and lived happily ever after with Patty.	Patty and Ben took Tori to Animal Control.

She barked and barked to get the worker's attention, but no one seemed to pay her any attention.    After two long hours, a tall man, named Joe, opened up her cage and looked at the charm on her collar.  He smiled at Tori and gave her a pat on the head.  Patty was there quickly, and gave Tori a big hug.  She was so happy to see her puppy again.  Tori learned to never escape the backyard again and lived happily ever after with Patty.

non_entailment	There once was a beautiful, brown puppy who loved her life.  Her name was Tori.  Every morning, Patty brushed out her fur and feeds Tori her favorite breakfast.  One Tuesday morning, Patty had an early errand and forgot all about Tori.  Tori was sad, but chose to make the best of it, and leaped out of her doggy door to play in her backyard outside.  As she was playing with her favorite ball, Tori saw an opening in the fence.  Excited, she ran over to the fence and squeezed out.  She had never been on the street by herself before.  Tori ran down the sidewalk, and happily barked at all the other dogs she passed.  She loved to wag her tail in the summer breeze and was having a great time.    All of a sudden, Tori was picked up by Ben and Mike, and thrown into a truck.  She was lost and confused.  Poor Tori didn't know what to do!

non_entailment	One day John and Sally's mother made up her mind to bake a very special cake for her son and daughter, but she didn't have the ingredients. She told John and Sally to go to the grocer's to buy the things she would need.  "I'll need some popcorn, a pea, some melon balls, and a cup of yogurt. I'm going to make a very special cake today," she said.  "Wow, that sounds horrible," said John.  "Yeah, we'd rather watch TV and eat potato chips," said Sally.  "Don't talk back, kids. Do what I said and head into town. It's a beautiful day. Go the long way and follow the river until you get there. Don't take the short way through the forest. A lion has escaped from the zoo. He might be hiding in the forest."  So John and Sally started the walk into town, but because they were disobedient children, they didn't follow the river like their mother told them. Instead they took the short way through the forest.  "I'm not afraid of a lion in the forest," said John. "Besides, I think mom has been eating too many melon balls and is letting her imagination get away from her again. If there were a lion in the forest, we would know about it."  So they wandered along the forest path, jumping in mud puddles and throwing sticks at one another. But as soon as John and Sally were in the darkest part of the forest, they heard a terrible roar. It was the lion! Horrified, they ran for their lives out of the forest, all the way back home.  "We're sorry!" they both said to their mother. "We'll never be disobedient again!"  And from that day forward, whenever their mother told them to do something, they did it right away like they were told.	They saw the lion happened when John and Sally got into the darkest part of the forest.

So they wandered along the forest path, jumping in mud puddles and throwing sticks at one another. But as soon as John and Sally were in the darkest part of the forest, they heard a terrible roar. It was the lion! Horrified, they ran for their lives out of the forest, all the way back home.  "We're sorry!" they both said to their mother. "We'll never be disobedient again!"  And from that day forward, whenever their mother told them to do something, they did it right away like they were told.	John said the very special cake sounded horrible.
non_entailment	One day John and Sally's mother made up her mind to bake a very special cake for her son and daughter, but she didn't have the ingredients. She told John and Sally to go to the grocer's to buy the things she would need.  "I'll need some popcorn, a pea, some melon balls, and a cup of yogurt. I'm going to make a very special cake today," she said.  "Wow, that sounds horrible," said John.  "Yeah, we'd rather watch TV and eat potato chips," said Sally.  "Don't talk back, kids. Do what I said and head into town. It's a beautiful day. Go the long way and follow the river until you get there. Don't take the short way through the forest. A lion has escaped from the zoo. He might be hiding in the forest."  So John and Sally started the walk into town, but because they were disobedient children, they didn't follow the river like their mother told them. Instead they took the short way through the forest.  "I'm not afraid of a lion in the forest," said John.

He came across some friends, Bob the cat and Steve the dog. They chose to go looking for food together. They walked up and down the tracks looking for a wonderful meal to snack on, when they happened across a big huge melon. Bob asked the black cat if he like melons, the cat did not like melons. Bob asked the dog if he liked melons, Steve did not like melons either. Bob then ate the melon himself as they looked around for that tasty treat. They heard bells from the train coming by and then they finally saw the food they were looking for jump from the bushes over the tracks and run straight into the barn nearby. The black cat wanted to eat the mouse, so he chased him into the barn. Minutes later the black cat returned with his meal in his mouth to share with his friends.

entailment	Today was the Moon's birthday, and Ms. Star wanted to be sure to get the best gift ever for her friend Moon. She had no idea what she was going to get him! A rainbow sounded like a fun gift, but everyone has a rainbow, and she was sure that Moon had one too. Ms. Star looked all around space for the right gift for Moon. She asked Saturn was she was going to get Moon. "Oh, I think I'm going to get Moon a space puppy. He was talking about how much he loved dogs!" That sounded like such a good idea to Ms. Star, but since Saturn was going to get a space puppy, that meant that Ms. Star couldn't do it too! "Try asking Mars." said Saturn. "He might know what to get Moon." Ms. Star asked Mars. "Well," said Mars. "I know that I'm getting Moon a space ship, and that Neptune, Uranus and Pluto are going together to get Moon a new house." "Wow!" said Ms. Star. "How am I ever going to get Moon something as nice as a house, or a space ship, or a space puppy?" Mars thought about it for a little bit. "Hmm." he said. "Maybe you could make him something?" "What a great idea!" said Ms. Star. "I know what would be perfect to make for him!" That night, at Moon's birthday party, when Moon opened the gift from Ms. Star, he was the happiest he had been about any of the gifts. "It's the perfect gift! Thank you so much Ms. Star!" He pulled out of the box a beautiful sweater that Ms. Star had made out of her own star dust. "It's so cold here in space! A sweater is the best gift ever!"	Mars said Ms. Star coulddo Make something.

"Wow!" said Ms. Star. "How am I ever going to get Moon something as nice as a house, or a space ship, or a space puppy?" Mars thought about it for a little bit. "Hmm." he said. "Maybe you could make him something?" "What a great idea!" said Ms. Star. "I know what would be perfect to make for him!" That night, at Moon's birthday party, when Moon opened the gift from Ms. Star, he was the happiest he had been about any of the gifts. "It's the perfect gift! Thank you so much Ms. Star!" He pulled out of the box a beautiful sweater that Ms. Star had made out of her own star dust. "It's so cold here in space! A sweater is the best gift ever!"	Uranus all did Ms. Star have to ask to find the right gift for Moon.

A rainbow sounded like a fun gift, but everyone has a rainbow, and she was sure that Moon had one too. Ms. Star looked all around space for the right gift for Moon. She asked Saturn was she was going to get Moon. "Oh, I think I'm going to get Moon a space puppy. He was talking about how much he loved dogs!"

She is allowed outside, and we have a cat door in the kitchen so she can come and go as she pleases. She comes home at night, sleeps in her special box, and is here for breakfast before going outside for new adventures. We can lock the cat door so she can't go outside when we go on vacation. If we go on vacation for more than a few days, my mom comes over to check on her and feed her.   So it was very weird to wake up and see that she was not home for her morning food! My husband and neighbor and I called for her, but she did not come. Guess where she was? Trapped in the garage overnight!	my cat's is name Mom.

non_entailment	When Graham was a little boy, he really like giraffes.  They were his favorite animal to see at the zoo.  He liked giraffes more than elephants, pandas, tigers or lions.  He dreamed of going to Africa to see giraffes in the wild.  He told his family how much he liked them and they made sure he had plenty of books about giraffes.  At school, he often wrote his reports about giraffes.  He even painted his room with spots to look like a giraffe.  When he got older, he went to school to study giraffes and other animals.  Finally, during his final year of school, he went to Africa to study giraffes in their home.    While there he met many people who also liked giraffes.  He liked seeing how tall the giraffes were.  He found that their homes were being destroyed by people using the land.  Graham started an organization which raised money to help buy land for the giraffes to live on.  Graham used everything he knew about giraffes to teach other people.  He gave speeches, wrote books, made signs and sent letters telling people about the giraffes' home being destroyed.	Graham's favorite animal is Lion.

Finally, during his final year of school, he went to Africa to study giraffes in their home.    While there he met many people who also liked giraffes.  He liked seeing how tall the giraffes were.  He found that their homes were being destroyed by people using the land.  Graham started an organization which raised money to help buy land for the giraffes to live on.  Graham used everything he knew about giraffes to teach other people.  He gave speeches, wrote books, made signs and sent letters telling people about the giraffes' home being destroyed.	Graham think the giraffes needed helped because They had spots.

He counted the cars that passed by. Along the way he saw his friend Lisa, and waved to her. She waved back, and came over. "Hi Marvin," she said. "Do you want to go to the lake today?" Marvin smiled. "Yeah!" he said, "let me go home and get my things." So Marvin turned right around and went back home.	Marvin go right when he woke uped in The bathroom.
non_entailment	There was once a small, grey cat that lived in the woods. This was a lonely old cat that spent most of his time bullying other small animals that lived in the woods. Almost all of the other little animals who lived in the woods knew of the old cat, and warned everyone they knew to stay away from him.   One day a young mouse was out taking a walk to collect some berries. It was a nice day out, so the mouse chose to go down by the river to take a quick rest for a bit. When the mouse arrived at the river he found the perfect spot to rest. It was a small little area with soft sand to lie on, under a tree that gave a bit of shade. The mouse then sat back. After a little bit of time the mouse was fast asleep.   Not long after the mouse had fallen asleep, the cat caught a scent in the air of the young mouse. The cat walked slowly up to the spot where the mouse was sleeping and licked his lips. Right when the cat was about to catch the mouse, the mouse woke up.  "What are you doing?!" asked the mouse in surprise.   "I am trying to find dinner," said the cat.   The mouse smiled. "I collected extra berries today on my walk. Would you like to have some?"  The cat was confused. He had never been given such a kind thing. "Well, OK. Berries are not my favorite, but I guess that they are OK."   The cat and mouse then sat down together and ate a meal of tasty berries. It turned out that the cat was not so terrible after all-but had never been given kindness.	the cat was confused about The cat was confused about where the river was.

She knelt in front of her small garden and started to pull weeds, throwing each in a small trashcan nearby.  As she worked she listened to the sounds of her neighbor's boys, Sam and Carl, playing. Sometimes she stopped long enough to sip from her bottle of water.  Her work and the heat of the day tired her out quickly, so she put her gardening tools away, dumped the weeds into the larger bin, and went back into her house to cool down and do some of the other items on her to-do list.  She chose to do laundry so she could sit and read as the washer and dryer ran.  Eventually the laundry was finished washing and drying, so she folded the laundry and put it away.  She marked the chores she had completed her to-do list, then it was time for dinner.  First she filled the food bowl of her pet cat, Zoey, then she heated up some leftover lemon-garlic chicken saved from earlier in the week.  After dinner she made her bed with fresh sheets from the laundry she did earlier, finished reading her book, put on her pajamas, brushed her teeth, and went to sleep.

non_entailment	There was once a little boy named Jacob, who owned a dog named Pet. One day, Jacob was taking Pet outside to play. He picked up her favorite toy frog. When he did, he hit his elbow on the table. Ouch! He rubbed his elbow and frowned. Then he put his shoes on his feet, washed his hands, put on a jacket.  Jacob felt better, and went to open the door to the back yard. He walked outside. Once he got outside, he felt the cool breeze and the warm sun. They made him feel sleepy. He thought he would take a nap outside on the deck. He pushed two chairs together to make a bed. He climbed up and lay down. He used Pet's toy frog as a pillow. He lay his head on it. Pet curled up next to the chairs to take a nap too.   While Jacob and Pet slept, a bumblebee came flying by. It made a sleepy humming noise, and thought that the deck looked like a nice place to take a nap. A robin who had been following the bumblebee stopped too. The robin and the bee snuggled up together on the picnic table.  Jacob's mother looked out the window and saw Jacob, Pet, the bumblebee, and the robin all sleeping. "What a peaceful group," she thought. And then she yawned and said, "Now I am feeling sleepy too!"	Pet did the robin snuggle up with.

Pet curled up next to the chairs to take a nap too.   While Jacob and Pet slept, a bumblebee came flying by. It made a sleepy humming noise, and thought that the deck looked like a nice place to take a nap. A robin who had been following the bumblebee stopped too. The robin and the bee snuggled up together on the picnic table.  Jacob's mother looked out the window and saw Jacob, Pet, the bumblebee, and the robin all sleeping. "What a peaceful group," she thought. And then she yawned and said, "Now I am feeling sleepy too!"	Washing his hands made Jacob feel sleepy.

What she meant was that the day had finally come for our family trip to the nearby beach located beyond Eagle Point. She got our parents out of bed way before they were ready to be up, but they knew how much it meant to her so they put a smile on as mother made breakfast and father packed the family car with towels and umbrellas. We could barely hear him say how there wasn't much room for many items, but he fit it all together like every year. I warned him last go around to get something larger like a truck, or a van, even joking an airplane, but he stuck to his guns and stayed with cars.  Truthfully, I had forgotten about the trip and made plans with my friends, Lauren and Matthew. As sad as I was to have to back out, I called the two of them and let them know of my mistake. They understood, and soon after we all entered the car and went on our way to the beach. The ride and the actual activities were pretty fun! We went swimming, met some new families, and got a little reading in. Karen wanted to play in the sand, but there was a piece of metal nearby so our mother wouldn't let her.

When he arrived at school, he went to his first class which was gym class. In gym class, his gym teacher made him run laps around the track because he had been late to class. After he had ran his laps, he played baseball with his friends. Bob had wanted to play kickball or basketball, but his friends had chosen to play baseball. After gym class was over, he went to English class. In English class, he read a story about a lady who had fallen in love with a kitty. One day the kitty jumped out of the window in the lady's house and never came back. The lady was sad and wondered why her kitty would leave her. Bob was very moved by the story. After English class was over, he went to his third class of the day which was math. Bob kept quiet in his math class because he didn't know the answers to most of the questions the teacher was asking.

non_entailment	Once, there was a boy named Dan that was no older then seven or eight years old.  Dan lived with his mother Sam and father Spike in a small house in a dangerous neighborhood in New York city.  Before their move from Florida he spent most of his time outside at a park. In fact they moved around a lot.  They have also lived in Georgia and California and this was the first time being stuck inside. It got so bad he was looking forward to going to school. This boy was an only child and was not allowed to go outside to play.  Instead he spent most of his time locked inside his house alone with no friends to play with.  One day he got a great idea.  Why don't I ask my mom, for a pet?  He thought long and hard.  I can get a dog or cat. I don't like birds, fish or hamsters. This way I'll always have a friend to play with when I'm inside.  He thinks to run up to his mom and say mommy, mommy!  Can I get a new pet?  His mom told him that if he wanted a pet that he would have to show her that he could take care of it.  She gave him chores and said, "if you can do these chores for one month I'll get you a dog."  Every evening before bed he would clear the table, clean the bathrooms and nicely stack all of the dishes.  His mother was in awe in the fact the she never had to tell him to complete his chore.  At the end of the month his mother kept her promise a got him a new puppy.  The boy was in love at first sight but the boy wasn't sure if the puppy looked like a Bob or a Rick.  Finally he yelled,  "I'm going to call him Rick!"	Bird type of pet did the boy want.

entailment	I was really scared walking into school today. It was the first day of sixth grade and I was excited to be leaving elementary school, but I ended up going to a different middle school than all my friends since I moved across town last year. My name is Matt, but I'm going to try and not let anyone else know that as I'd rather sit in the back and keep to myself. I didn't want to ride the bus, so my mom said she would drive me there for today. Thankfully I found my classroom, but I walked in and saw nobody I knew, as I thought. I took a seat at an empty table as the teacher, Mrs. Frank took roll call. She seemed nice, and I'm happy we weren't told to sit in alphabetical order or by boys to boys and girls to girls, as I was free to sit by myself for now. Mrs. Frank called out Jimmy, Sally, Linda, Jason, and then finally got to my name in which I raised my hand quickly. As soon as she was done, a few of the kids who arrived late came to sit by me and said their names were Martin and Mark.  Martin said he liked how our names all sounded the same, and Mark seconded that as we started talking before class began. When it was time to eat, we all said we would sit with one another in the lunch room, and also when it came to recess and playing together. It was nice to have some friends after being so nervous earlier, and see that everything does work out in the end. Hopefully soon we can all play together outside of class, but as far as today, it was a great start!	Martin and Mark sat near Matt because They arrived late to class and other seats were filled.

The friendly nurse called Sam from the waiting room to finally visit the doctor. The nurse weighed Sam, measured his height, and asked him questions about the foods he had eaten that day.

entailment	Dr. Curtis  On a small farm outside of town, lived a boy named Curtis. Curtis was seven years old and he wanted to become an animal doctor someday. He always loved animals and helped take care of them on his family's farm.  Curtis liked to feed the horses, chickens, pigs, dogs, and the cat. He also like to help take care of them when they got hurt or sick. Once, Curtis stayed in the barn all night, helping his father with a sick pony. The animal doctor was there too, and Curtis watched everything that he did. The doctor had to keep giving Bonnie the pony some medicine. And he kept checking her eyes and mouth.  When the pony got better, the animal doctor went home. But Curtis and his father stayed in the barn with the pony until it became light outside. Curtis had gone to sleep, so his father carried him to their house and put him to bed.  Curtis was so tired that even the smell of bacon from the kitchen didn't wake him up. Later, his father came and woke him. "Bonnie is going to be alright," he said to Curtis.  "Really?" the boy said as he rubbed his eyes, "I got to go check on her."   "That can wait. Right now you need to eat something. I saved you some bacon, Mr. sleepy head," his father said as he smiled at Curtis.  Curtis washed, dressed, and ate as fast as he could and then raced to the barn. He stood on a stool and looked into Bonnie's eyes and mouth. He put his head on her chest and listened to her heart. Then he checked her legs and tail. He tried to do everything the animal doctor did and more.  Curtis saw his father standing at the door and said, "Everything looks okay, daddy. I think she can go out to the big tree with the other horses."  "Okay, Dr. Curtis," his dad said as he patted Curtis on the back. "Let's take her outside."

non_entailment	There is a large tree in a park where all the kids in the neighborhood can hang out and play.  The tree was planted in 1896 and has grown to over fifty feet tall with branches that were another thirty feet wide.  Next to the tree is a jungle gym.  The jungle gym has two slides, a fireman pole, a rock climbing wall, and much more.  One day the kids in the neighborhood came up with the idea of building a tree house so they could spend all of their time at the park, even when it was raining outside.  The children all went to their parents begging them to help and get wood.  The families of the neighborhood began building the master tree house.  Upon completion the tree house was ten by twelve feet high, with two windows, and plenty of space for the children to have fun.  Every day during the summer that year the children played in the park and went in the tree house from sunrise to sunset every day.  Fifteen years have gone by and the children are now too old to use the tree house.  The tree house still sits on the tree but instead has a new group of kids that get to enjoy the house.  Now the first kids have become parents and get to watch their idea live on and make the children of the neighborhood happy.	A slide was built on the tree.

One day the kids in the neighborhood came up with the idea of building a tree house so they could spend all of their time at the park, even when it was raining outside.  The children all went to their parents begging them to help and get wood.  The families of the neighborhood began building the master tree house.  Upon completion the tree house was ten by twelve feet high, with two windows, and plenty of space for the children to have fun.  Every day during the summer that year the children played in the park and went in the tree house from sunrise to sunset every day.  Fifteen years have gone by and the children are now too old to use the tree house.  The tree house still sits on the tree but instead has a new group of kids that get to enjoy the house.  Now the first kids have become parents and get to watch their idea live on and make the children of the neighborhood happy.	at the park for the children to was play with a tree and a sand pit.

non_entailment	Jane was a dog who lived all alone, in a broken freezer in a dump. There was all kinds of junk in the dump, from a car, to a wooden cow, to a clock, but Jane's favorite thing she had was a giant sock. Jane was always chewing at the sock, and kept it with her in her freezer. When Jane was not chewing on the sock, she was running around in the dump, looking for things to eat, or things that were fun to sniff, or that she could bark at. Still, even when Jane was having fun doing other things, her favorite thing of all to do was chew on her giant sock. Sometimes Jane would see other animals in the dump. There were always birds around, as well as sometimes a snake, and once even a cat. A deer even came through once. Jane was quick to start barking at the cat, and she quickly scared it away and it never came back. The birds were something that Jane was always trying to catch. She was never fast enough, they would always fly far away before Jane even got close. But that didn't stop Jane from barking at them whenever she saw them. Jane liked being active. Even when Jane was all alone, she was active. Jane was a happy dog.	Jane liked the most Wooden cow.

One time Tiger accidentally lit a bush on fire when he was playing with a looking glass and the bush burned to the ground. Tabby was very mad and Tiger blamed it on Tom. Tabby believed Tiger, because she thought Tom was a trouble maker. One time Tabby took a trip to the ocean and she took Tiger, but not Tom. Tom was very upset, but acted like he didn't want to go. Tom said he would rather go to the forest, the moon or the mountains, but never would he go to the ocean. This wasn't true, but Tom didn't want to let Tiger and Tabby know that they hurt him. When Tabby and Tom went to the ocean, their uncle Leon came to visit and to take care of Tom. Tom had never met Leon before. Leon loved Tom and made him feel very special. When Tabby and Tom came home Leon left and Tom went to live with him. They went to the ocean together; the mountains, the forest and Leon even took Tom to the moon. Tom was happy, because he got to see things that Tiger never got to see. They lived happily ever after.	Tiger was Tabby's favorite nephew.

entailment	There was once a frog who lived all the way in the North Pole. His name was Isaac. He worked at Santa's factory, baking cakes with lots of frosting. He didn't like making cake much. In fact, Isaac's dream was to work in the factory with the elves making toys. But since he was a frog, he was never allowed to build toys with the elves. One day, he got a smart idea. He would dress up as an elf and sneak into the factory, hoping no one would find out. So he got a hold of an elf costume and put it on. He put on the elf hat, the elf shirt, and the elf shoes. He really looked like an elf! So one day, when the factory was opening for the morning, Isaac snuck in line with the rest of the elves and tried to get into the factory. Luckily, it worked, and no one found out! Isaac was filled with joy as he had never seen the inside of the toy factory before. It was huge, and there were thousands of elves building toys for the children for next Christmas. He joined them in building, and for a long time, no one knew he was a frog. That is, until one elf, named Joe, saw that there was something weird about Isaac. He didn't look like the rest of the elves. So he kept his eye on Isaac, waiting to see what his secret was. One day, Isaac slipped, and his hat fell off. When this happened, Joe saw that he was a frog, and not an elf! He told Isaac that he would tell Santa all about how he had snuck in. Isaac begged Joe not to tell. Joe wanted to know what was in it for him, so Isaac promised to bake him a cake with lots of frosting. Joe never told.	A frog was Isaac.

Isaac begged Joe not to tell. Joe wanted to know what was in it for him, so Isaac promised to bake him a cake with lots of frosting. Joe never told.	Isaac lived in In the toy factory.
entailment	There was once a frog who lived all the way in the North Pole. His name was Isaac. He worked at Santa's factory, baking cakes with lots of frosting. He didn't like making cake much. In fact, Isaac's dream was to work in the factory with the elves making toys. But since he was a frog, he was never allowed to build toys with the elves. One day, he got a smart idea. He would dress up as an elf and sneak into the factory, hoping no one would find out. So he got a hold of an elf costume and put it on. He put on the elf hat, the elf shirt, and the elf shoes. He really looked like an elf! So one day, when the factory was opening for the morning, Isaac snuck in line with the rest of the elves and tried to get into the factory. Luckily, it worked, and no one found out! Isaac was filled with joy as he had never seen the inside of the toy factory before. It was huge, and there were thousands of elves building toys for the children for next Christmas. He joined them in building, and for a long time, no one knew he was a frog.

She could go as an angel all in white or as a rabbit with a basket of eggs.  She thought that wings would be too hard to make.  Allie went to ask her mom if she had any eggs to go in her basket.  Her mom said that the eggs might break and told her to use carrots instead.  Allie looked in the refrigerator but there were no carrots.  She took some spinach instead.   Allie got an old pillow case out of the hall closet.  She would use it to carry the candy she would get.  Allie's little sister, Grace, was going as a princess dressed in pink.  She had a shiny, silver purse on her arm.  Allie took Grace by the hand and led her down the sidewalk.

One day Joe saw a White moving truck down the street from his and Nate's tree house. Joe got really excited and told Nate about it. Nate and Joe waited, hoping to see another boy that could join their club.  The Boy's Club started when they were 6 and their dads helped them build their tree house and paint it dark blue.  Joe and Nate both wanted more friends so they could play team games like baseball and football. Nate started day dreaming about playing baseball. Joe started thinking about how fun football would be. They don't like playing board games, Go Fish or Old Maid any more. They were both looking out the window of the tree house, waiting for the family to get out of the dark blue van that pulled up next to the moving truck. The sun's bright yellow light made it hard for the boys to see as the van door opened Nate looked close and yelled out "There are three boys"!  Both boys got really excited and started walking down the street toward the new family. Nate broke into a run and brown dust started coming up from the ground behind his feet. Joe started running to catch up to Nate. They made it to the house quickly and one of the new boys gave a strange look as Nate and Joe both held their knees trying to catch their breath.  A few seconds later Nate stood up and said, "Hi I'm Nate and this is Joe. Do you want to join The Boy's Club"? The boy said, "Sure. Can my brothers be in the club too? And Joe said, "YES!" The boy took a step back and said, "Well, I'm Jacob and my twin's name is Josh. We are 9 and our little brother is Alex. He's 7." Nate and Joe started planning games and made friends quickly with the new boys.	brown and yellow color was the van and the tree house.

non_entailment	Millie thought she would like to stop eating meat, but she didn't know if she could do it.  Once, when she was younger, she had tried to go without eating meat, but before the first day was over, her stomach had felt a little empty.  "Hmm," she had thought.  "Maybe it's not good for me to stop eating meat.  Maybe that's why I feel so hungry."  But, now, she wondered if there was anything she could do so she wouldn't feel so hungry, even if she did stop eating meat.  She went to the library, and there, she saw a magazine.  Below the title, the cover said, "Learn to live on vegetables!"  She read in the magazine that it was good to change her meal plan slowly.  If she really felt hungry for a little meat, the magazine said, it was okay to have some, and then go back to eating her veggies.  She also read that beans could give her body a lot of the same things meat could, but that eating things like rice and noodles would help the beans do a better job of building her body and giving it energy.  That way, she would feel better, instead of feeling so hungry!  Millie wasn't sure if it would work this time, but the magazine's tips made her want to give it another try!	Millie thought after reading the magazine She wanted to go to the library.

Just to put on a show, Harry walked around the room in his ball until his master had left. As soon as his master shut the door, Harry took off towards the outside! He ran towards the door, slipped through the doggy door, and rolled himself outside. He was free! He could see the large trees, and the high grass. Harry looked around, and knew he had found his place in the world.	Harry escaped in Winter.
non_entailment	Harry was a good hamster. He would run on the wheel in his cage every day. On Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and on the weekends, his master would even put him a plastic ball that allowed him to run all across the house, as long as he stayed in the ball. Harry loved the plastic ball, and he even liked his master, but Harry wanted to see the outside of the orange house he had lived in for as long as he could remember. He wanted to feel the rain on his fur, wanted to eat wild seeds that fell from the tree. He wanted to be free! He would watch the flowers come up in the spring from his window, and the snow fall in the winters, always wanting to know what the seasons felt like.    One Tuesday morning in the summer, Harry woke up to the sun shining down into his cage in the middle of the room that he stayed in. "Today is the day I see the world!" Harry yelled to himself.

Bob knew that he did not want to eat too much candy, but he wanted to get some candy anyway. He went to the box of candy and put some in his shopping bag so he could buy it. Bob went to the front and paid for all of his food. After buying his food, he went home and ate it. The sandwich was delicious and after he ate the sandwich he ate the candy too. Bob was very happy that he was full now and no longer hungry.	Bob bought at the store A picture of a cat and a sandwich.

First you must clap for me."  Boo clapped many times.  "Now," spoke Miles, "You must chirp like a young bird."  Boo chirped happily.    "Last," said Miles, "You must fold my laundry.

entailment	Randan's parents surprised her one day by bring home a small bunny. This was the first pet she had, so she started to shout and scream happily right when she saw it. After having keeping it in a cage in the house for a couple hours, she tried to take it outside to play. That was when everything went wrong. After she stepped outside, the cage fell and her thumb accidentally opened the cage, and the bunny ran away. Randan got very sad, but the bunny sounded like it was singing as it ran off.  Later that night, Randan was still sad about the bunny as she was lying on her bed. All of a sudden, she heard a loud bang so everybody ran outside. They found the trash can tipped over and a lot of the food ate from it. Her dad wondered who did it, and Randan wondered if it was the bunny that ran away. She said to herself that it could not have done it. The bunny was way too small to even shake a trashcan. Nothing special happened for the rest of the week, until they heard a strange noise on another night. This time, only Randan and her Dad went outside to check out what the noise was. When they made it outside, they saw an animal the size of a bear digging in their yard before it went deep. Before they even knew it, they heard their mama screaming from inside the house. They both looked in the window to see the bunny cornering the mama, but it had grown ten times bigger and looked angry. The dad quickly gave Randan a magical glove that makes her grip one million times stronger. The dad got some glue and made the bunny's butt stuck on the carpet. Randan grabbed the bunny by the leg and threw it to space.	the first and second time the bunny was come back on At night on the same day, and a week later.

non_entailment	There was once a young bear who lived in a small cave in the woods. His cave was comfy, warm, and dark, and had a bit of a yard in front of it. The bear lived with his mother and father, and spent his days walking around and his nights curled up asleep. He liked to look for berries to eat. His favorite berries were blueberries, but he would eat any berries he found: strawberries, raspberries, cherries, anything.  There was a river near the bear's cave, and he loved to sit on the bank and look at the fish and frogs, and at his own reflection in the water. One sunny afternoon, when he was looking into the river, he saw a family of ducks swimming by. He got up and followed them. They swam along in the river, and he walked along the bank. They traveled like this until they reached a small clearing in the forest. The bear stopped and looked around, and saw that the clearing was completely filled with blueberries -- more than he had ever seen!   The young bear ate his fill of blueberries, then took home as many as he could carry in his paws. He went to bed happy. It was a wonderful day.	the bear followed fish.

Steve couldn't help himself, he wanted to be inside and at a table so badly. The restaurant had pictures of all the people that used to work there in the past, it had been around for a long time with a history of such great food. It was not the first time his mother had to tell him to slow down.  When they were taken to their table and went through the curtain to the dining area, Steve had another nice surprise waiting for him. It would not be a table for three, his favorite aunt and uncle were waiting at the table for them! Steve sat down quickly to get some of the bread sticks before they were all gone.  Steve did not even need a menu, he knew what he wanted. Bring on the spaghetti and meatballs, nice and hot!	Steve and his parents were all the people going to eat.

non_entailment	I once was the leader of running a skills camp for a Boy Scout group. The weekend long camp included a lot of different games. One of the games was for fire-building. The point of the game was to help teach campers how to best build fires. There are many different ways you can build a campfire. You can build a lean-to campfire. You can also build a teepee fire. To build the fires you must find and sort different sizes of sticks and brush and larger logs to get the fire going. The goal of the game is to build a fire big enough to burn a string that is hanging a few feet above the ground. My group was falling behind, so I gave the idea of throwing a bunch of leaves on the fire all at once to make a huge fire to quickly burn the string. We were not allowed to win the game because it was said we cheated.	Did the group win the game Yes, by using a bunch of leaves.

To build the fires you must find and sort different sizes of sticks and brush and larger logs to get the fire going. The goal of the game is to build a fire big enough to burn a string that is hanging a few feet above the ground. My group was falling behind, so I gave the idea of throwing a bunch of leaves on the fire all at once to make a huge fire to quickly burn the string. We were not allowed to win the game because it was said we cheated.	Did the group win the game There was no game.

non_entailment	Once there was a turkey named Tim, who enjoyed playing house, playing football and riding his bicycle all the time. His favorite food would be corn, which he enjoys licking when it is still on the cob. But his parents spank him to try to get him to stop doing that, as he often burns his tongue when the cob is too hot. He enjoys watching football games as well, he always cheers and claps for his favorite team, the Gobblers. In a game he watched last week, the other team, a chicken team named the Clucks, were playing as well. It was a close game, but the Gobblers ended up winning with a little luck. Tim's best friend was also watching the game, Tony the lizard, and they both enjoyed watching the game together!	Clucks won the football game.

John thought she was an evil superhero at least. When John got to the bus stop, Ashley made a silly face at him. Then she dared him to lick a worm she found on the sidewalk. John had super powers, so he said yes to the dare. He picked up the worm. It was slimy and gross. It wiggled around between his fingers. John closed his eyes and licked it. Ashley laughed so hard, she fell to the ground. But John felt like a real superhero who had won the day for good kids everywhere. First thing tomorrow, John would start wearing a cape to school. He hoped his mommy would let him wear it. The bus came and Ashley was still sitting on the ground laughing. John had a great, superhero kind of thought. He put the worm in her hair. Now Ashley was screaming! John the superhero got in trouble for that.	The worm was a good superhero.

non_entailment	One morning, Billy was giving some milk to his lamb, Beverly. He heard a noise coming from a nearby rock. He went to see what was making the sound, and Beverly followed him. He looked around the rock, but couldn't see anything. Billy tried to lift the rock with a stick, to see what was under it, but it was too heavy.   "I wonder what's making that noise," Billy said. Beverly ate some grass. He went back home. Beverly followed him.  Billy asked his wife, Judy, if she had anything that could lift the rock. She looked around the kitchen and found a spoon and a towel. "Use the spoon to dig under the rock," she said. "Then you can put the towel under the rock, and pull it towards you."  "That's a good idea," Billy said. He dug under the rock with the spoon. Then he tried to pull it towards him with the towel, but it was too heavy.  Then Beverly, the lamb, started pushing the rock with her forehead. At first, the rock only rolled around in its hole. Then, when Billy pulled and Beverly pushed at the same time, it rolled downhill.  "Thank you, Beverly," Billy said. "I couldn't have done it without you."  Billy and Beverly looked where the rock had been. In the middle of the circle of dirt, they saw a little cave with some baby bunnies in it. The bunnies looked hungry, and were crying for food. Billy went back home and told Judy, and she gave the bunnies some lettuce.	Billy finds under the rock Beverly.

non_entailment	Sally wants to learn how to cook. She has only made peanut butter and jelly sandwiches before.  Today she is going to try to make some spaghetti with meat sauce.  First she goes to the store down the street to buy the food. She buys six tomatoes, some beef, seasoning, one box of pasta and ten pieces of fruit.  When she gets home she goes to the kitchen and starts boiling some water. The water takes four hundred seconds to boil.  Next, she cuts up the beef and puts it in a pan to fry it. When the beef is cooked she starts to cut the tomatoes. When she is finished with the tomatoes she puts them in the pan and puts a lid on top. Once the tomatoes get hot she adds the seasoning and mixes the sauce.  Finally she adds the cooked pasta to the sauce. Sally thinks that her spaghetti with meat sauce smells really good! She takes some to the table and starts eating her dinner. Her table is in the dining room. Sally wants to cook more foods tomorrow, maybe she'll make some fried rice!	Sally made today Fruit.

non_entailment	A boy named Pedro was walking down the street one day, and he met a pretty girl in a pink dress who handed him a bell. It was made of metal, and looked worn and old. The girl said, this bell gave me my wish for a pink dress, but in order to keep my wish, I have to give the bell to someone else. Ring the bell three times to get your wish. Not two, not four, but three. When your wish arrives, give the bell to someone else. Pedro thanked the girl for the bell, and when she had gone, he rang the bell three times and wished for a puppy. Soon after, he saw a puppy on a street corner. It was black with brown and white spots. He picked the puppy up and hugged it. Then he saw his friend Alice. He gave the bell to Alice, who rang the bell and wished for a pretty bird. Soon a pretty bird landed on her shoulder. Alice thought the bell was a wonderful thing, and chose to keep it, rather than give it away. The next day when she woke up, her bird had flown away.	A puppy was not wished for in the story.

She is a real cutie, and I am very proud of her grades. To pass the time, I played my triangle. In my youth, I was a triangle player in a large New York band, the Black Triangles. We all wore full black costumes every time we played.  "What lovely triangle music! You make me think of a friend I had once upon a time."   A strange lady, about my age, was standing next to me, talking!  She was holding a trumpet. It turns out the strange lady was my old friend and Black Triangle trumpet player Matilda. We hadn't seen each other since New York. Matilda told me she wanted to keep in touch, but couldn't remember what I looked like! We found out that all we remembered were the black costumes we always wore! It turns out; Matilda was also there to pick someone up from school.  "Well, Sandra, why don't you join me and my grandson for lunch? There is a lovely Thai place right down the road.'  We went there with my granddaughter and her grandson, and had a delicious meal. Our grandchildren got married 15 years later.	Sandra was in the Good Grades New York band.

A strange lady, about my age, was standing next to me, talking!  She was holding a trumpet. It turns out the strange lady was my old friend and Black Triangle trumpet player Matilda. We hadn't seen each other since New York. Matilda told me she wanted to keep in touch, but couldn't remember what I looked like! We found out that all we remembered were the black costumes we always wore! It turns out; Matilda was also there to pick someone up from school.  "Well, Sandra, why don't you join me and my grandson for lunch? There is a lovely Thai place right down the road.'  We went there with my granddaughter and her grandson, and had a delicious meal. Our grandchildren got married 15 years later.	Sandra was Matilda there to pick up.

non_entailment	My brother Ryan is 12 years older than me. He is my best friend, and the coolest human on Earth. Right before I turned 7 one summer, he left home to join the Army. He thought about joining the Marines, the Air-Force, or the Navy, but he liked the Army better. He was away for a long time. I didn't see him again until I was almost 8! He wrote me letters when he was gone, and sent me stripes from his uniform that Mom sewed on my jacket. We hung the flag on our front porch. We missed seeing him, so we talked to him on Skype. We could see the smile on his face when we talked to him. I missed him a lot. When Ryan came home again that Monday, it was the best day of my life! We went to the airport to pick him up. He had a long trip. It took many days for him to travel back home. He left the Army base 4 days before he finally got home. He was glad to sleep in his own room again. He let me camp out in his room. We stayed up late talking in whispers. He told me stories about the Army. Mom let me miss school the next day. I spent the whole day with my brother. He likes to chase me around and tickle me when he catches me. He lets me ride on his shoulders. I like to ride in his truck. I like to watch TV with him. We went on adventures. We laughed a lot. Ryan's visit went by too fast. Soon, it was time for him to go back. He left for the Army on Friday. It was a long way for him to ride in the airplane. He got back on Tuesday. I can't wait to see him again. Next time, we'll visit him on vacation. I want to see the Army trucks and helicopters.	Ryan send to him that Mom did sewed on his jacket stars.

non_entailment	My brother Ryan is 12 years older than me. He is my best friend, and the coolest human on Earth. Right before I turned 7 one summer, he left home to join the Army. He thought about joining the Marines, the Air-Force, or the Navy, but he liked the Army better. He was away for a long time. I didn't see him again until I was almost 8! He wrote me letters when he was gone, and sent me stripes from his uniform that Mom sewed on my jacket. We hung the flag on our front porch. We missed seeing him, so we talked to him on Skype. We could see the smile on his face when we talked to him. I missed him a lot. When Ryan came home again that Monday, it was the best day of my life! We went to the airport to pick him up. He had a long trip. It took many days for him to travel back home. He left the Army base 4 days before he finally got home. He was glad to sleep in his own room again. He let me camp out in his room. We stayed up late talking in whispers. He told me stories about the Army. Mom let me miss school the next day. I spent the whole day with my brother. He likes to chase me around and tickle me when he catches me. He lets me ride on his shoulders. I like to ride in his truck. I like to watch TV with him. We went on adventures. We laughed a lot.

He had been carrying Bob around on his back for almost five years, and both of them knew every inch of the range on which they rode. Bob's job was to keep watch over the cattle who ate and grew fat off the nice grass which grew on the range near the farm. It was a good job for cowboy Bob. He was a friendly cowboy with a nice beard, but he still preferred to be alone most of the time. He never got lonely on the range, with his horse Steve to keep him company and the nice view. As he did his job, he would sometimes get wet from the rain, and every day he would have to rise before the sun did, but still Bob was very happy, and he was never sad or angry or scared. Watching the sun rise orange in the distance was always a fun way for Bob to start the day. Sometimes, Bob would even sing to keep the cattle calm. Bob also had to keep the other animals away from the cattle, the wolf and the snake and the coyote. Bob and Steve were happy having each other as friends.	The name of the horse was Steve.

non_entailment	It was a boring day out on the range for cowboy Bob. He was riding around on his horse. It was a good animal, and its name was Steve. Steve was an old friend to Bob. He had been carrying Bob around on his back for almost five years, and both of them knew every inch of the range on which they rode. Bob's job was to keep watch over the cattle who ate and grew fat off the nice grass which grew on the range near the farm. It was a good job for cowboy Bob. He was a friendly cowboy with a nice beard, but he still preferred to be alone most of the time. He never got lonely on the range, with his horse Steve to keep him company and the nice view. As he did his job, he would sometimes get wet from the rain, and every day he would have to rise before the sun did, but still Bob was very happy, and he was never sad or angry or scared.

entailment	A man named Albert had the choice to build a tree house, a garage, a desk, or a cabinet.  Albert chose to build something big to share with his kid, so he wanted to make a tree house.  Albert had to choose what kind of stuff to make the tree house out of.  Wood is popular, but splinters would hurt his son.  Metal is very strong, but it would also be very hard to use.  Plastic is not expensive, but it also bends a lot. The last choice was to give up, but Albert really wanted to do this for his son.  It would make him very happy.  Albert ended up choosing wood, as it was the most popular choice.  Albert went to the store to buy nails, tools, and wood, but forgot to buy glue.  He had to go back there and he finally had everything he needed.  He got started and it was very hard.  One hour went by, then two, then three, then four.  Finally, on the fifth hour, Albert finally finished the tree house.  His son ran out and jumped into his dad's arms.  They both looked at it, and Albert's son gave his dad a kiss for all the hard work he had done.  Albert looked at the tree house he had built and was very happy.  He had done it all by himself, and he was happy to see his son being so happy as well. They would have a long summer of playing together in the tree house that Albert built.  It was one of the best tree houses ever!	it took five hours Albert to build the tree house.

The game ended with his home team winning by one run. The screams of the fans could be heard from very far away. On his way home he stopped at a dinner to have some dinner. When eating he saw some other fans come in and start belting out some songs and laughing. After dinner he looked at the menu and wanted some dessert. His choices were marshmallow and chocolate cake, apple pie with ice cream, warm brownies with ice cream, or a vanilla shake. He loved the taste of marshmallow so he went with that. On his way home he thought someone was tailing him so he turned off into a coffee store. When they drove by he went home.	Joey chose Marshmallow and chocolate cake.
