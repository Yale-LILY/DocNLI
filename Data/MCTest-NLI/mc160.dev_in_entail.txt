non_entailment	My parents, Kelly and Kelley, said that it was that time of year to take a family vacation.  We've been to big ride parks that have hotels with large pools.  This year my parents wanted to do something different.  They wanted to take us all to Elk River Castle.  After lots of planning we hit the road for our trip.  My Brother Kelsey and I enjoyed the long car ride there.    Once we arrive, the castle looked much bigger than we had imagined.  There was so much to see and so much to do.  There was a swimming pool, movie theater and an elevator to take us from floor to floor.  What a magical place!  I was so excited because we had the whole place to our family!

This made Ana very nervous, but when she looked out and saw her dad cheering her on she knew she could do it. The spelling bee had five rounds and Ana made it through them all. She was now in the finals. During the final round James, the boy she was in the finals with, was given a really hard word and he spelled it wrong. All Ana had to do was spell this last word and she would be the winner. Ana stepped to the microphone, thought really hard and spelled the word. She waited and finally her teacher said "That is correct". Ana had won the spelling bee. Ana was so happy. She won a trophy. Ana also won a big yellow ribbon. The whole school was also happy, and everyone clapped for her. The whole school went outside. They had a picnic to celebrate Ana winning.	Her best friend helped Ana study everyday.

non_entailment	Roger was a grasshopper. He loved to hop. He hopped everywhere by himself. One day when he was hopping around he bumped into a frog sitting on a log. The frog told him his name was Gilbert. Gilbert told Roger that it had been a long time since he bumped into anybody. Roger told him that since both grasshoppers and frogs like to jump they would make great friends. The next day they were hopping through a field and they saw something very strange.  In a pond they saw a spider floating on a lily pad. The spider was very sad because he did not have any friends. Roger and Gilbert asked him why he didn't have any friends. The spider told them that everybody would scream and run away when they saw him. Roger and Gilbert told him that he didn't look scary to them and that he could come along with them if he wanted. So Sam the spider said yes, and the three of them began a life time friendship full of adventures.	Roger liked todo Bump.

"Luna, I have no use for socks because my legs and toes have thick feathers. Go visit one of the animals that walk on four legs. They might have extra socks you could borrow."  Luna flew across the field and landed next to the icy creek. Rose the raccoon was teaching her six babies how to wash their paws. The water was very cold, but the babies were having fun.  "Rose, my bare legs and bare toes are so cold, may I please borrow a pair of your socks?" begged Luna.  Rose laughed hard. "Silly Luna, I do not have socks. Look at my legs and feet. They are covered with thick, warm fur. I'm sorry I cannot help you. Go visit the humans. Sometimes I tip over their garbage cans at night when I am looking for food. Once I saw a pair of socks."  Luna was very afraid of humans. Her grandmother and mother had warned her about them. She was told that some humans are mean and hurt hawks.

The socks were hanging on the clothesline by two wooden pins. Luna used her powerful beak to break the pins. She put on the socks and then flew back to her home in the huge tree. When she landed, her feet were warm and dry. Luna was very happy.	Olive the owl not had any socks because She had given her socks to another friend.

non_entailment	Douglas loves to play soccer. He plays for the Dolphins. He is very good.  He was excited about the big game with the Lions.  The night before the game, he went to bed late.  He was watching three TV shows that night.  First, was Muffins the Cat.  The second show was Ernie the Talking Donkey.  The third was Laughing with Herman Hamster.  His Mom told him to go to bed, but Douglas didn't listen.  He fell asleep on the couch. He dreamed all night.  First about sheep jumping fences.  Second about playing fetch the ball with Ruffles. Third about Ernie the talking Donkey kicking a soccer ball over the moon. Fourth about his favorite soccer player, Pele, head the ball in the goal.  Finally, the next morning, Douglas got up late because he was so tired.  His Mom called him and the alarm went off, but he did not hear. To get Douglas up, his Mom got Ruffles the dog to lick him in the face.  Douglas got up but had to eat breakfast fast.  Then he quickly dressed into his uniform.  He was yawning.  His Mom drove him to the soccer field.  The game had started.  Douglas had to sit out the first quarter.  His team was losing one to nothing when Howard scored for the Lions. Douglas started the second quarter.  He was tired and could not keep up with the rest of his team.  The coach was surprised that Douglas was so slow.  Usually he was fast.  After the second quarter, the Dolphins were losing two to one after Howard scored again for the Lions and Toby scored a goal for the Dolphins. While the coach gave energy drinks to the team, Douglas fell asleep.  The third quarter started.  Douglas was snoring when the coach told him to go in.  When he saw Douglas was sleeping, he sent Billy into the game.  Billy scored one goal and the Dolphins had tied the game two to two.

Third about Ernie the talking Donkey kicking a soccer ball over the moon. Fourth about his favorite soccer player, Pele, head the ball in the goal.  Finally, the next morning, Douglas got up late because he was so tired.  His Mom called him and the alarm went off, but he did not hear. To get Douglas up, his Mom got Ruffles the dog to lick him in the face.  Douglas got up but had to eat breakfast fast.  Then he quickly dressed into his uniform.  He was yawning.  His Mom drove him to the soccer field.  The game had started.  Douglas had to sit out the first quarter.  His team was losing one to nothing when Howard scored for the Lions. Douglas started the second quarter.  He was tired and could not keep up with the rest of his team.  The coach was surprised that Douglas was so slow.  Usually he was fast.  After the second quarter, the Dolphins were losing two to one after Howard scored again for the Lions and Toby scored a goal for the Dolphins. While the coach gave energy drinks to the team, Douglas fell asleep.  The third quarter started.  Douglas was snoring when the coach told him to go in.  When he saw Douglas was sleeping, he sent Billy into the game.  Billy scored one goal and the Dolphins had tied the game two to two.  Ruffles the dog started barking and then licking Douglas in the face.  Douglas got up and stretched.  He was finally well rested.  The coach saw Douglas and sent him into the game.  Douglas remembered his dream.  In the last second, he headed the ball in the goal like Pele. He won the game. The team cheered.  Since that time, Douglas goes to bed on time.  He always wants to be well rested.  His Mom was right.  He gave her a hug.	Douglas loves to play Douglas loves to play cards.

non_entailment	On a hot summer day, Brian was walking home from the park. While walking, Brian passed his favorite toy store, and saw that they had a new baseball glove in the window.  Brian's baseball glove was very old and was ripped in a few places.  Brian really wanted the new glove because he wanted to show off his glove to his friends tomorrow. The cost of the new glove was fifteen dollars, but when Brian checked his pockets for money, he only had six dollars and fifty cents.  Brian ran home and went to look around his house for money. He checked under his bed and found fifty cents under some toys.  He then checked all of his pockets of his pants and shorts, and found another two dollars.  Brian then went to look between the cushions on all of the couches in his house, and he found another three dollars.  After finally looking around his whole house, Brian knew that he still did not have enough money to buy the new glove.  Brian went outside and saw his dad doing yard work. He told his dad that he would finish all the yard work for him, if he could have the money he needed for the new glove.  His dad said yes, so Brian spent the rest of the afternoon raking the yard, and bagging leaves.  Brian's dad was very proud that his son was working hard for money. When Brian was finally done, Brian knew that he was too late, and the toy store was closed.  Just as Brian was walking inside, he saw his dad walk up to home holding the new glove that he wanted.  Brian was so happy, and he and his dad spent the rest of the afternoon having a catch.	Brian dad bought him the glove because His dad wanted to him to practice.

non_entailment	On a nice and sunny day, Bob and Sally walked to the beach. When they got there, the first thing they wanted to do was to look for buried treasure. To find the treasure they had brought two shovels and two buckets. They both started digging holes in the sand with their shovels. After looking very hard for treasure for an hour, they didn't find anything. This made Bob and Sally very sad. They gave up and went to play in the water. While they were playing in the water, Sally found a bottle with a little paper inside. Sally opened the bottle and found a treasure map. Sally showed the map to Bob and they started to look for the treasure.  After walking every step that the map said, they started digging with their shovels. After digging a really a big hole, they found a box. They were very happy that they found it and wanted to see what was inside. Bob slowly opened the box and there was a very big pearl.  Next, they ran to a special store to ask about the pearl. The worker in the store told Bob and Sally that the pearl could make them rich. Bob and Sally looked at each other and decided not to sell it. They took the pearl home and saved it in a special box, so they could remember their day at the beach.	Bob and Sally found in the box A coin.

non_entailment	It was a beautiful sunny and warm day. I was working outside in my garden. I was pulling weeds which is not my favorite job, but I was enjoying the day. I live by a lake so sometimes I take a break from my chores and look at the lake. It is so beautiful and it makes me happy to look at the beautiful lake and see what animals I can find swimming in or near the lake.  On this day, I kept hearing a low soft sound coming from the lake. I got up from my garden and walked to the lake. I kept hearing this strange sound. It sounded like someone talking in a very low voice. I thought it might be a lake bird because we see and hear them all of the time. The lake birds have several different calls that tell what they want to "say" to other lake birds. There is the call when they are flying which is very hurried and short. Then there is the "where are you" call which is long, slow and loud. But this sound was not like any I had ever heard. I went to get the binoculars to see if I could spot anything. But, no luck. I still kept hearing this low talking sound. I had now totally given up weeding. Finding this strange sound was going to be more fun. But where was it coming from? I looked again up and down the lake and saw nothing. Finally I went around to the other side of the place where we keep our boats. There is an area there where it is not a very deep part of the water. I spotted them! It was a mother lake bird and a father lake bird with a baby in between them. They were teaching the baby how to swim and eat fish. The low talking sound that I heard must have been them trying to teach the baby to swim and eat the fish. I sat there on the bank and watched for a half an hour. I felt very special that I got to see this. It was such a fun thing to see and way more fun than gardening.	I doing on this day at the beginning of the story was fishing.

The lake birds have several different calls that tell what they want to "say" to other lake birds. There is the call when they are flying which is very hurried and short. Then there is the "where are you" call which is long, slow and loud. But this sound was not like any I had ever heard. I went to get the binoculars to see if I could spot anything. But, no luck. I still kept hearing this low talking sound. I had now totally given up weeding. Finding this strange sound was going to be more fun. But where was it coming from? I looked again up and down the lake and saw nothing. Finally I went around to the other side of the place where we keep our boats. There is an area there where it is not a very deep part of the water. I spotted them! It was a mother lake bird and a father lake bird with a baby in between them. They were teaching the baby how to swim and eat fish. The low talking sound that I heard must have been them trying to teach the baby to swim and eat the fish. I sat there on the bank and watched for a half an hour. I felt very special that I got to see this. It was such a fun thing to see and way more fun than gardening.	I doing on this day at the beginning of the story was cooking.
non_entailment	It was a beautiful sunny and warm day. I was working outside in my garden. I was pulling weeds which is not my favorite job, but I was enjoying the day. I live by a lake so sometimes I take a break from my chores and look at the lake. It is so beautiful and it makes me happy to look at the beautiful lake and see what animals I can find swimming in or near the lake.

non_entailment	One day Magneson took a walk in the park.  He passed some trees and a pond.  In the pond was a duck named George.  George's wife was also in the pond.  Her name was Nancy.  Magneson walked over to the tree.  Nancy flew up into the tree.  She wanted to warn Magneson about the killer squirrel who lived inside of the tree.  A few years before, the squirrel had thrown a chestnut at George and Nancy's son.  He was knocked out, and the squirrel took him away.  He was never seen again.  Magneson asked what their son's name was.  They said it was Leonard.  But Magneson was only making small talk.  He didn't believe the story about the killer squirrel.  Even if there was one, there were many rocks by the pond that he could throw at the squirrel.  He could also hide in the tall grass.  George and Nancy were sorry to see that Magneson wouldn't listen.  They flew away, singing a sad song.  A short time later, the squirrel came out of the tree and threw a giant walnut at Magneson.  No one ever saw Magneson again.	George's wife's was name Magneson.

non_entailment	Once there was a young boy named Bret who had a cat named Wolfgang.  The boy had really wanted a wolf for a pet, but his mother said wolves liked to hog the bathroom and liked to blow things down and they snored.  So the boy had to call his cat Wolfie.  He had also thought about naming his cat Sir Purrsalot.  Bret himself planned to become a knight when he grew up (or maybe a cowboy) and thought Sir Purrsalot sounded like a good name for his brother knight.  The difficulty there was that Wolfie didn't purr a lot.  He purred when he was being fed or petted, but no one could say he purred a lot.  Plus Bret's mother said knights liked to poke things with their swords and they also liked to hog the bathroom and they clanked.  So Bret was left with a cat named Wolfgang.  The neighbors gave him strange looks when he stood in the front yard in the evening and yelled "Wolfie!  Here Wolfie!!!", to get Wolfgang to come in for the night.  But Bret didn't care what anyone else thought.  He had a Wolfie and maybe he'd end up becoming a pet doctor when he grew up instead.	Wolfie purred on when hogging the bathroom.
