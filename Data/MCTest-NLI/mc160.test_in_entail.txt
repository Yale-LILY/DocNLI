non_entailment	The family across the street has a cat. He is a cute black kitty named Dillon. The cat is about two years old, and the family has had him for about a year. He is an indoor cat who is not allowed to go outside. The children like to play with Dillon because he still acts like a kitten. Dillon jumps around, and chases flies, beetles and spiders. When he plays with the children, he sometimes uses his paws to attack them, but he doesn't try to hurt them with his claws. Dillon is a great cat but he has one problem: he likes to eat bread. The family only feeds him cat food, never human food like steak or potatoes. But the cat likes the smell of bread so much that he tries to find it everywhere he can. Dillon jumps up on the kitchen table when a sandwich is there, and tries to carry it away. He finds loaves of bread from the store on the floor and claws through the wrappers. The cat climbs into the bread cupboard looking for hot dog and hamburger buns. The family tries to make Dillon stop getting into the bread by spraying him with water when he goes after bread. They yell at him when he walks on the table. But Dillon does not listen. The kitty keeps trying to find bread to eat.

That way if it rains, we can still make a cake," Emma says.   "Good idea!" Abby smiles, happy again.

We have 3 other dogs and Reggie is older than all of them.  They all listen to what Reggie tells them to do.  It is fun to see them respect him.  We are watching Reggie now.  He is staying with us for 3 weeks.  He likes to go for rides in the car.  He likes to go for walks.  This time, when Jim and Linda dropped Reggie off, Jim picked up mom's guitar and played us a song.  He was really good!  Then Jim and Linda sang a song for us.  I can see why Reggie misses them when they are gone.  They are so nice!  We give Reggie lots of love so that he is happy at our house when they are on vacation.  He likes our dogs and cats.  We have a big black dog named Able.  We have a little dog named Mudpuppy and we have a puppy named Goldberry.  We have two cats.  One of our cats is named Glitch.  She has lots of colors.

Upon entering the woods the girl and her dog found that the woods were dark and cold. The girl was a little scared and was thinking of turning back, but yet they went on. The girl's dog was acting very interested in what was in the bushes up ahead. To both the girl and the dog's surprise, there was a small brown bear resting in the bushes. The bear was not surprised and did not seem at all interested in the girl and her dog. The bear looked up at the girl and it was almost as if he was smiling at her. He then rested his head on his bear paws and went back to sleep. The girl and the dog kept walking and finally made it out of the woods. To this day the girl does not know why the bear was so friendly and to this day she has never told anyone about the meeting with the bear in the woods.

non_entailment	Yesterday, Emily and Evelyn went to the zoo with their mom. They left the house right after breakfast so that they would be there when the zoo opened. Once inside, they raced to see the monkeys swinging around their cages. There were even two baby monkeys!  The girls also enjoyed feeding birds in the walk-in bird cage. The birds were very interested in picking seeds from the popsicle stick that Emily held out to them. Next, it was time to stop for ice cream. Each girl chose a small cup of soft ice cream. Emily chose a swirl of chocolate and vanilla and Evelyn had chocolate. Ice cream at the zoo was the perfect treat on a hot summer day.  The best part of the girls' visit was the giraffe area. They walked past rhinos and tortoises to get to the giraffe area which was on a raised deck. The giraffes stretched their necks up to the deck to eat leaves and hay that were placed there for them. Emily and Evelyn bought special crackers to feed to the giraffes. Emily liked that she could pet the giraffes when they reached out to grab the crackers with their long tongues. Evelyn liked to watch the giraffes, but did not want to feed one herself. After feeding the giraffes, the girls left the zoo, hot and tired and ready to return soon!	birds type of animal did Emily and Evelyn visit first at the zoo.

"What are you doing, Cotton?!"   "I only wanted to be more like you".   Cotton's mommy rubbed her face on Cotton's and said "Oh Cotton, but your fur is so pretty and special, like you. We would never want you to be any other way". And with that, Cotton's mommy picked her up and dropped her into a big bucket of water. When Cotton came out she was herself again. Her sisters licked her face until Cotton's fur was all all dry.   "Don't ever do that again, Cotton!" they all cried. "Next time you might mess up that pretty white fur of yours and we wouldn't want that!"  Then Cotton thought, "I change my mind. I like being special".	orange and white striped color was Cotton's fur.

entailment	On a sunny day in July, Sylvia left the front gate open. From the spot where Rex was napping in the grassy yard, he had listened to the sound of the gate sliding open, and waited for it to snap shut. It didn't. The click of Sylvia's shoes faded into the distance, and yet the snap of the shutting gate didn't come. Finally, Rex pushed himself up on one paw so he could look towards the front of the yard, where the gate moved in the breeze. Rex moved slowly towards the gate at first, but as he neared the sidewalk he shot through the opening, his shiny black fur twinkling in the sun as he sped down the street. Rex ran from block to block through the neighborhood, with no leash to pull him back. When all four legs started to burn from running, Rex slowed down and started sniffing the grass around him. His stomach growled and he hoped he'd find some food in the grass. All he found was sidewalk chalk, a few little black ants, and flowers that made him sneeze. The sun was going down, and Rex thought about Sylvia coming home to rub his ears and fill his food bowl. He looked up and down the sidewalk for his home. Nothing. Rex was lost. He stood completely still and raised his ears as high as they would go. He sat and listened, and listened and sat. Just as the sun passed over the mountains in the distance, Rex heard, from very far away, the soft "click click click" of Sylvia walking towards the house. Rex ran home.	Rex looking is forward to about going home Sylvia rubbing his ears and feeding him.

non_entailment	When I was a little boy, I could remember my mom making breakfast and dinner for us. And I remember one night, when she had made dinner after a long, hard day at work. On that evening, my mom placed a plate of vegetables, salad and burned chicken breast in front of my dad. I remember waiting to see if anyone saw, yet all my dad did was to reach for his chicken breast, smile at mom and ask me how my day was at school. I don't remember what I told him that night, but I do remember watching him drop hot sauce on that chicken breast and eat every bite.  When I got up from the table that evening, I remember hearing my mom apologize to my dad for burning the chicken breast. I'll never forget what he said. "Dear, I love burnt chicken breast."  Later that night, I went to kiss daddy good night and I asked him if he really liked his chicken breast burnt. He put his arms around me and said "Dear, your momma put in a hard day at work today and she's real tired and a little burnt chicken breast never hurt anyone."	mom went to kiss dad good night.

non_entailment	Jamal made his mommy a special card for her birthday.  When he gave it to her, she smiled and said that it was beautiful.  His dad also gave her a card, but she did not smile the same way.  Mommy didn't look mad, but Jamal knew that she was disappointed.    The next day, Jamal's dad drove him to school.  Jamal said "Daddy, did Mommy not like your birthday card?"    Jamal's dad said, "Well, son, sometimes I don't know what your mother likes.  I could have asked her or thought of something better."    Before Jamal got out of the car, he asked his dad, "Can we go to get ice cream after you pick me up from school?"    "Sure, that sounds good to me," said Jamal's dad.

Jamal giggled and ran to the plant store nearby.  Jamal remembered that when Mommy took him to his grandma's house, she told Grandma that she always wanted to have a lily plant.  They found a lily plant in the store.  The woman who worked at the store asked, "Do you want to put this in a pot?"

They had lived there a long time and there was lots of food close to the home. Their favorite foods were carrots and lettuce which grew at the farm next to their home. She had some friends that were birds. They were robins. She did not like the unfriendly black birds. They were loud and would take her food if they could. She loved to play tag with her brothers and sisters and their friend Rocky. He was a squirrel. The creek had a waterfall, it was fun to play around. They would go to the creek for fresh water and sometimes to take a bath. When the frogs made noise the bunnies would laugh. They thought it was such a funny sound. When the bunnies found some wild strawberries they ate them. They thought they were great, but they did not care for the blueberries. There were a lot of big rocks that they played on and around.	Mandy and her family lived in Under a rock.

non_entailment	Logan had lots of toys. He had balls, dinosaurs, race cars, and even robots! Logan had so many toys he had a room for his toys. There he could play with whatever he wanted, when he wanted, and not even have to pick them back up. Logan had all kinds of balls. He had red ones, green ones, blue ones and even a pink one he hid from his sister. His robots were so cool they could change shape, fly, or race. Some even saved the world in his imagination. Logan loved his dinosaurs. He had one with big sharp teeth, one with little tiny arms, one with purple spots, and even one that his dad said didn't eat anything but plants and vegetables. Logan's favorite toys were his race cars. That was because when his dad came home from work he always went to the toy room with Logan to play with his race cars.
